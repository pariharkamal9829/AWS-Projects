This project demonstrates how to build a serverless URL shortener using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. It is designed to be beginner-friendly and includes step-by-step instructions for Windows users.

Features
Generate short codes for long URLs.
Redirect users to the original URL using the short code.
Fully serverless and scalable.
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account: Sign up at AWS Free Tier.
AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI on your Windows machine.
Download the AWS CLI installer from here.
Run the installer and follow the prompts.
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and configure the AWS CLI:
aws configure
Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and output format when prompted.
Python 3.x: Install Python 3.x from python.org.
During installation, ensure you check the box to Add Python to PATH.
Postman (optional): Download and install Postman from here for testing the API.
Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Set Up DynamoDB Table
Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to DynamoDB.
Click Create Table.
Table name: URLShortener
Partition key: short_code (String)
Click Create.
Step 2: Create the Lambda Function
Navigate to AWS Lambda in the AWS Management Console.
Click Create Function.
Function name: URLShortenerFunction
Runtime: Python 3.x
Permissions: Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions (AWS will automatically create a role).
Click Create Function.
Step 3: Add Code to the Lambda Function
In the Lambda function editor, replace the default code with the provided Python code (see the lambda_function.py file in this repository).
Deploy the function.
Step 4: Set Up API Gateway
Navigate to API Gateway in the AWS Management Console.
Click Create API.
Choose HTTP API.
Click Build.
Add Routes:
POST /shorten (for creating short URLs).
GET /redirect (for redirecting to the original URL).
Integrate with Lambda:
For each route, select the URLShortenerFunction Lambda function.
Deploy the API:
Click Deploy.
Create a new stage (e.g., prod).
Note the API endpoint URL (e.g., https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod).
Step 5: Test the URL Shortener
Using Postman (Recommended for Windows)
Create a Short URL:

Open Postman.
Set the request type to POST.
Enter the URL: https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/shorten.
Go to the Body tab, select raw, and choose JSON.
Add the following JSON payload:
{
  "long_url": "https://www.example.com"
}
Click Send. You should receive a response with a short_code.
Redirect to the Original URL:

Set the request type to GET.
Enter the URL: https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/redirect?short_code=<short_code>.
Click Send. You should be redirected to the original URL.
Using Command Prompt or PowerShell
Create a Short URL:
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/shorten" `
 -Method Post `
 -ContentType "application/json" `
 -Body '{"long_url": "https://www.example.com"}'
(Note: Use backticks ` for line continuation in PowerShell.)

Redirect to the Original URL:
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/redirect?short_code=<short_code>"
Step 6: Clean Up
Delete the DynamoDB table.
Delete the Lambda function.
Delete the API Gateway.
